- For each trip: (find one trip per shape and just process that. should end up with 2 (one per direction) per service pattern, in theory)
  - get the geojson line, really just need the coordinates TBH
  - for each segment (between stations):
    - slice line between points, note length, and note time
  - also note station order for trip and deduplicate arrays of trips 
  - while we could check for duplication here, its best to use overwriting for simplicity's sake
    - besides, any time saved by service pattern deduplication would probably be far outweighed by the cost of comparing trip stop times.

- build shapes
- build stop time segments between stations
- split up shapes based on closest point to various stations
- store elements 

- when having to find location when one isn't given:
  - find last station and next station (based on next two stations)

BIG FUCKING THING TO NOTE:
- because the cta HATE ME theyve decided each yellow line round trip is A SINGLE TRIP so it kinda breaks my algo.
- always check for [route id]_[next station]_[next station] on top of normal [route id]_[next station]_undefined to account for this little bit of funny business
